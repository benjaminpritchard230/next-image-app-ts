# README
## Overview
Welcome to my social media platform, where users can create an account and share their own images. Users can also view other users' images, like and comment on them, and receive notifications when someone likes or comments on their posts. Additionally, users can create a profile with an avatar and an "about me" section, view other users' profiles, and follow other users.

## Technologies Used
This website was built using the following technologies:

## Next.js: A popular React framework that simplifies the creation of different routes on the website.
MUI: A React UI library that provides many useful components for building complex websites with a lot of user interaction.
Typescript: Used to ensure type safety in handling data returned from the backend.
RTK Query: A powerful data fetching and mutation management library that was used to handle data fetching and mutations on the website.
The backend of the website was written in Python using the Django framework and was hosted on PythonAnywhere, a cloud-based platform that makes it easy to deploy, run, and scale Python applications.

## Getting Started
To get started with the website, simply create an account and start sharing your images. You can also view other users' images, like and comment on them, and follow other users.
